# Essential Linux Command Line Tips for Daily Use

Whether you're a system administrator, developer, or tech enthusiast, mastering these Linux commands will significantly improve your productivity. Here's a curated list of essential commands and tips that I use daily.

## File Operations

### Finding Files
```bash
# Find files by name (case-insensitive)
find . -iname "*.log"

# Find files modified in the last 24 hours
find . -mtime -1
```

### Text Processing
```bash
# Search for text in files
grep -r "error" /var/log/

# Quick file content view
less +F /var/log/syslog  # Follow mode (like tail -f)
```

## System Monitoring

### Resource Usage
```bash
# Real-time process monitoring
htop

# Disk usage with human-readable sizes
du -sh *

# Check system load
uptime
```

### Network
```bash
# Monitor network connections
ss -tuln

# Check DNS resolution
dig example.com

# Test connectivity
mtr google.com
```

## Productivity Tips

1. **Use History Wisely**
   ```bash
   # Search history
   Ctrl + R
   
   # Repeat last command
   !!
   ```

2. **Directory Navigation**
   ```bash
   # Quick directory stack
   pushd /path/to/dir
   popd
   
   # Jump to previous directory
   cd -
   ```

3. **Command Chaining**
   ```bash
   # Run commands in sequence
   command1 && command2  # Run command2 only if command1 succeeds
   command1 || command2  # Run command2 only if command1 fails
   ```

## Pro Tips

1. **Use tab completion** - Don't type full paths
2. **Create aliases** for common commands
3. **Learn screen or tmux** for session management
4. **Use ctrl+l** instead of typing 'clear'
5. **Master pipe operations** for command chaining

Remember: The best way to learn these commands is to use them regularly in your daily work. Start with basic commands and gradually incorporate more advanced ones into your workflow.

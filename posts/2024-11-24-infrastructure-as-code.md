# Getting Started with Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is revolutionizing how we manage and provision computing infrastructure. Instead of manual configuration or using interactive tools, with IaC you write code to define your infrastructure.

## Why Infrastructure as Code?

1. **Consistency**: Every deployment follows the same pattern
2. **Version Control**: Track changes and roll back when needed
3. **Automation**: Reduce human error and save time
4. **Documentation**: The code itself serves as documentation

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with IaC is to pick a tool and start small:

1. **Terraform**: Great for multi-cloud infrastructure
2. **AWS CloudFormation**: Perfect if you're AWS-focused
3. **Ansible**: Excellent for configuration management

```hcl
# Example Terraform code
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  
  tags = {
    Name = "example-instance"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

- Start small and iterate
- Use version control
- Implement proper state management
- Follow security best practices
- Document your code
